# PyCity Schools Analysis

## Insight 1
* Per this data set, charter schools performed better on both math and reading scores.
* This manifested in the top 5 schools being charter and the bottom 5 schools being district.

## Insight 2
* Reading and Math scores by grade showed no noticeable variability, reading scores were generally higher than the math scores, driven by charter schools

## Insight 3
* There seems to be a sweet spot in school size by way of the data. Overall passing scores were a bit higher for the medium and smaller schools.

## Addtionial Analysis Needed
* In order to draw a true hypothesis, we may want to analyze the following:
    1.) A look at gender mix in each school and correlate from school size, type 
    2.) A look at the teacher ratio to student population to see if that affects math and reading scores 
    3.) Look for in the data if there is a charter school size group where test scores aren't as high
